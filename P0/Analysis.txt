P0: Worst-Case Big-O Notation
Task0-
O(1) as we are accessing an element and printing it.

Task1-
O(n) as we are looping through all elements twice (separately) and printing once

Task2-
O(n) as we are looping though all elemets of calls. And O(n) twice as we are looking up list twice

Task3- O(n + n log(n))
O(n + n log(n)) as we are looping through all the elemts of calls. And Sorted taking O(n log(n)). And O(n) 4 times as we are looking up list 4 times.

Task4-O(n + n log(n))
O(n) as we are looping through all the elements of calls twice separately and O(n + n log(n)) as looping through all the elements of the sorted list to print
